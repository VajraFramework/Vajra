<p class="smalltext">
Note that most of the directions below apply to both 32bit and 64bit windows except where specifically noted otherwise.
<br />
!! However !!, the precompiled binaries and libraries which are mentioned below are applicable only for Win64 (if you are using Win32, you'll have to compile them from source yourself)
</p>

a. Installing required tools:

<br />

<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 1: The MinGW compiler suite:</i></b>
<br />
We'll use the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) suite of compilers and other tools.<br />
Note that while you can get it from the official page at http://www.mingw.org, for convenience there is a preinstalled version provided here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7FDWl_RV-KKc0NtMUdXZE5heTQ&usp=sharing">MinGW.tar.gz</a>
<br />
It is highly recommended that you download this copy (since it comes pre-installed with all the libraries needed for building Vajra on Windows64)
<br />
<br />
Extract the downloaded MinGW folder into any location on your hard drive (preferably C:\ since that is a standard path, although it isn't required that it be in C:\ for Vajra)
<br />
Assuming you extracted it to C:\ (which you really should!) your folder structure should have C:\MinGW\bin\
<br />
<br />
Now, add "C:\MinGW\bin\" to your system's Path variable.
To verify, at this point you should be able to go into the windows cmd prompt and type "mingw32-g++.exe -v", and it shouldn't tell you that no such program exists. A restart *may* be required after setting the path, although it shouldn't be.
<br />
<br />
Alright. We have MinGW.
</p>



<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 2: Eclipse for C++:</i></b>
<br />
We'll be using Eclipse with the CDT plugin for C++ development. You can download Eclipse pre-bundled with CDT here:
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/keplersr1">Eclipse Kepler with CDT</a>
</p>



<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 3: Cygwin:</i></b>
<br />
Cygwin provides a linux-like command-line environment in windows. Its awesome.
You can get the cygwin setup file here <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe">Cygwin 32 bit Installer</a>
<br />
!! Note !! The link above reads "32bit cygwin installer". Its not a typo. <br /> Do NOT install the x86_64 installer which is also available via Cygwin's website.
<br />
<br />
Run the installer, and preferably stick to all the default settings until you arrive at the page called "Cygwin Setup - Select Packages"
<br />
Leave everything at default (because the defaults are good enough), but specifically search for a package called "rsync" (in the little search text box in the top-left) and mark that package to be installed.
<br />
Finish the rest of the installation (it might take a long time for cygwin to finish installing)
<br />
One more thing: Assuming you installed cygwin to the default location of C:\cygwin, add "C:\cygwin\usr\bin\" to your system's Path variable.
<br />
<br />
To verify, at this point you should be able to go into the windows cmd prompt and type "bash.exe", and it shouldn't tell you that no such program exists. A restart *may* be required after setting the path, although it shouldn't be.
<br />
<br />
Alright. We have Cygwin.
</p>

b. Downloading the source code:

<br />

<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 1: Read about git:</i></b>
<br />
Real talk. Spend at least 30minutes to review git concepts. You won't regret it. <br />
<br />
</p>


<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 2: Download git tools of your choice:</i></b>
<br />
Now, there are a lot of git GUI tools available out there and you may use any of those. However, it is highly useful to also have a git command line to fall back on (at least for the first step (below)).
I highly recommend getting this: <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">Git for windows</a>
<br />
When you are done installing that (with all the default options), you should have "Git Bash" installed on your computer.
Fire up Git Bash; you should be at a minimalistic command prompt. Navigate to a folder of your choice and clone the repository:
<p class="code">
> git clone https://github.com/VajraFramework/Vajra.git
</p>

<p class="indented">
This, should clone the main repository in your current location. However, before you can build, you need to get some of the Tools/ needed to build.
<br />
These tools are stored as a git "submodule" and in order to get them you need to step into the newly cloned Vajra/ folder and init an dupdate the submodule, like so:
</p>

<p class="code">
> cd Vajra/
<br />
> git submodule init
<br />
> git submodule update
</p>

<p class="indented">
Feel free to use any GUI frontend for git to make things easier from this point onwards.
<br />
</p>

</p>



<br />
c. Building the source code (Finally!):


<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 1: From the windows cmd prompt:</i></b>
<br />
Just this once, we'll build it from the cmd line. Feel free to skip this step and move on to Step 2 below which uses eclipse.
<br />
Open up the windows cmd prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and type:
<p class="code">
> build.bat windows
</p>
</p>

<p class="indented">
Note that just typing "build.bat" will print usage information and such.
</p>


<p class="indented">
<b><i>Step 2: Using Eclipse:</i></b>
<br />
Launch the Eclipse you downloaded. When prompted, set the workspace to be the top level folder ("Vajra") of the repository on your hard disk.
<br />
This will init an empty workspace. Now, import (File->Import) "Existing Project into workspace" and point it to the "VajraFramework" folder inside Vajra/
<br />
<br />
This should load up the project inside the workspace with pretty much everything configured. Note that there will be multiple named build configurations (Linux, Windows, and Android)
<br />
At this point, you can select the "Windows" build configuration and it should get built.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, there should be multiple Run/Debug configurations. Select the "VajraFramwwork Run" (or Debug) configuration to run (or debug) the application.
<br />
You should be able to use all your standard debugging tools from the toolset, or use the built-in gdb console.
<br />
